- my work involves annotating images that are harmful to humans. 
- in our survey papers, we identified two risks of developing CMU technologies. The first risk is mental harm to annotators. And now this video just shows that it is real.

A lot of issues about annotation as a job are shown:
- Time pressure
- Lack of decent rewards
- Harmful nature of the content (Facebook did it with 10K images) 

I mean, it is likely that SOMEONE has to do the labeling. It happens to be citizens of less developed countries, due to the opportunity costs that are high for them not to do it.

But these things need to be mentioned. The humans who do annotations need to be protected as rightful laborers. Only when such constraints are put that the researchers on the other side of the supply chain be aware of their responsibilities and problems. Technical solutions will be set in place correspondingly. Move fast, but be responsible!
