Hello! This page serves as my informal and 'non-standard' self-introduction.

I have been consistenly fascinated by numbers and computers, probably since 2015 when I began to specialize my training in Maths and coding. I started out as a Math student in grade schools, before switching to Computer Science for better job prospects. But to be fair, programming always feels as magical as telekenesis to me. I may skip a lunch to try building a mobile app, for no reason. 

Regarding my personalities, my friends tell me that I am philosophical and optimistic. I usually ask people about their purposes in life. I believe most people are born with a purely kind heart, grow into badness at varying degrees, and can be good if they will.

I love team sports. I mostly play ultimate frisbee and badminton, while enjoying watching soccer.

If you have anything in common with me, say hi! I do like making new friends.

## Hall of Shame
*In reversed chronological order. To be updated.*
- [July 2023] I lost a nice pair of sunglasses that my Dad gave me :(
- [June 2023] In my graduation ceremony, I walked much faster than I intended, thus could not enjoy the claps from the audience (which I have been daydreaming about). Now it's over. Next one: my post-grad graduation...
- [2023] I lost my wallet, containing important documents and some money.
- [College] I was proudly rejected by IJCAI, a big-deal CS conference.
- [College] I played Chess poorly. I lose most of my matches in my chess club. Chess is definitely a big failure of my life.
- [College] I have turned off Facebook notifications about reactions, but I am still checking it manually :)
- [First year of college, 2020?] I saw a businesswoman I had seen before. To know if she still remembered me, I asked 'Do you miss me?'
- [At high school, 2019] I wanted to study in the US so I tried ACT. My Reading score is 12/36. Every reading test was a nightmare.
- [September 2016] I was excited to start my new life away from home for the first time. On the first day of highschool, I lost my smartphone :)
- [At middle school, 2013] I fell into mud before a class. My clothes looked like sh*t, literally.
