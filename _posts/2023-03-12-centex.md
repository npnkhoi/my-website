I went to [Centex](https://play.usaultimate.org/events/Centex-Tier-2-2024/schedule/Men/CollegeMen/), a frisbee tournament in Austin.

## The games

Pre-tournament goals: My goal overall is to keep the intensity consistent across games and not re-injury myself. Defense-wise, I will try to not get beat on the forced side more than once/match. For offence, no throwaways by always looking for reset after the 3rd second.

Post-tournament: 
- My legs did not allow me to hop on the field as much on the second day, but I was intense every time I was on the line. And I did not reinjure myself. 
- Defensively, I got beat deep a 1-2 times, which is ok. After that, I always try to stay over the cutters, and body the cutters a lot more this time, and it works. To avoid wasting energy, I also positioned myself to see both the disc and the cutter, or sometimes just kept touching the cutter to not lose them. And I almost never got beaten force side.
- Offensively, I handled a lot more than usual and did pretty well. About three throwaways, including 2 upfield to cutters that were not open, and 1 reset because my off-handler could not get open. But overall I handled much more carefully than usual, so much fewer drops. I also cut pretty well I think.

## The city
Eaten at Spice Garden (good), Kerbey Lane (good), Pho Phi (ok), and Tumble 22 (ok). Went to The Domain, which is a shopping mall as a town, where shops are distributed across streets. Didn't enjoy it that much.
