I have not been using the train that frequent. It is still an somewhat attractive travel option within 10 hours, compared to buses. But this time I did not enjoy it that much due to (1) impolite co-passengers (too evasive with their body) and (2) tedious waiting times during the trip resulting in nearly 12 hours of sitting!
