Last night I stayed up until 2.15am doing programming for a free-lancing job. This morning, I feel like there is no life in me.

I was aware that this morning I need to wake up at 5 (so I should have go to bed at 9-ish). However, I was so into the project that I let time pass (a real [flow state](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224927532_Flow_The_Psychology_of_Optimal_Experience)). For every 30 minutes, I looked at the clock and got surprised by how fast time went, but unable to put a hold on the work. I was tired, but unable to realize that it is necessary to stop.

I hope I will be more capable of saying “let’s call it a day”. Otherwise, I would suffer the next day being tired, unproductive, resentful, fearing of death by lack of .

P/S: The title of this post is referencing the famous book [Why We Sleep](https://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Sleep-Unlocking-Dreams/dp/1501144324) by Mat Walker. I read half of the book, appreciated the importance of sleep, and get bored by the monotonicity of the narrative.
