title: Day schedule in Military Training
---

I actually like almost everything about my recent Military Training (which is a formal requirement for all Vietnamese college students to graduate). In these busy and arguably non-disciplinary days, I am nostalgic about the nice schedule of the military. We were waking up at 5.30, quite naturally, enjoying the fresh air of the highland region and doing morning exercise collectively. All days went by in the same rythm and ends at 10pm when everyone goes to sleep. Probably should try that rythm again!
