title: Frisbee at UTD

I have played ultimate frisbee at UT Dallas twice. Impressed by how strong the senior players here are. But I have also seen strong players in Vietnam. They both look far stronger than me. Perhaps the goal is not to be stronger than any of them, but to have meaningful time being physically active and making friends that share such a common interest.

Things to work on:
- Offence: cut and clear, prediction of disk landing
- Defence: stamina, game intelligence
