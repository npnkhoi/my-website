After several practices with WOOF -- the Ultimate Frisbee team at UTD, I realized quite a few useful lessons to improve my playing. They are mostly about offence in a free-style type of team.
- Cutting:
    - As a team, offenders should cut into any open space available. There are always someone standing right next to an open space (mathematically!). Therefore, each offender should see where the team is not covering, then either let the people next to those spaces cut into them, or you do it.
    - Never dance. Three fakes max. Then run strictly towards or away from the handler. If the handler is being forced to the sideline, strike or dumb.
    - When clearing, I used to be clueless of where to go. Now I know a good spot -- the space behind the maker of the current handler. That is the least offensible place on the field. So run to it.
- Handling:
    - Flick: Don't lean backwards because the throw would be weak or going upwards. Throw flat, and time it correctly.
    - For a backhand, use all the wrist for maximum spinning.
