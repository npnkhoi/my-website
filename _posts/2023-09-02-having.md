I am having so much. My gears are totally functional, but not expensive. My bed is comfy and aesthetic. My clothes and footwears are also functional and comfy. My kitchenwares are convenient. To the broader sense, I live in a house of abundant resources, whose rent I can afford comfortably with my salary. I have full scholarship to a school where the library is huge, the gym is very modern, classrooms are optimized for big-scaled lectures, and the sport fields are so big that I could not dream I can legally play on regularly.

Materials mean comfort, paid by money. Morally, that is not something one should optimize all their resources for. I read about [Bao Dai](https://vi.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%E1%BA%A3o_%C4%90%E1%BA%A1i), the last king of Vietnam. He retired on September 2nd, 1945 (which is today *exactly* 78 years ago). As a king of a country, we basically used and burned his power into money to spend for comfort. He died at 93 years old in 1997 in France. Was that a happy life? Objectively, experts say he is not virtuous because he was too extravagant while careless about the struggles of millions of people in Vietnam. He could have done a lot of things for the country with his *given* power. But he chose to optimize his personal comfort. He probably felt very comfy, and maybe happy. It really depended on his outlook to life. What people say now (mostly criticism) does not matter to him anyway.
