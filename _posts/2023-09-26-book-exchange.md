I’m looking for people to participate in a huge book exchange. All you have to do is buy your favorite book (just one) and send it to a stranger (I’ll send their details through in a private message). 

You’ll receive a maximum of 36 books back to you, to keep. They’ll be favorite books from strangers all over! 

If you’re interested in taking part, email me at "npnkhoi at gmail dot com" with Subject: Book Exchange
