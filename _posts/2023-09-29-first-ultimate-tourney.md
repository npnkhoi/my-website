Lessons these days:
- When handling
    - Use 10 seconds like this (assuming team is playing Vertical Stack): 
        - First 3-4 seconds: look up field, communicate with the disc for teammates to clear.
        - From 3rd to 9th second: Activate the off-handler by pivoting to face them, stick with them until the 9th second (don't look up field again).
        - The moment marker says "nine": Look up field, make a flat and hopeful huck to the space.
        - => This is a very pro-flowing strategy. Good for windy days. Low turn-over rate. Longer possesion. Higher chance of scoring of course.
    - After passing? Almost as a give-and-go, make an immediate strike. If being faked, either clear or dumb.
    - How to throw? 99% being forced flick. I throw OK. Just fake with my shoulder to shake the defender a bit. Then **step out horizontally** and throw **a flat disc to the open space**.
    - What are the usual faults the defender usually commit here?
- When cutting
    - Choosing the right opponent player matters. Observe those who is at the same level to match with them.
    - When game is slow, observe the stack, run a setup to create space, and *sprint*. 
    - When the game is fast, look for the best-gain space (usually up-line) to run into. But be careful not to double cut.
    - If being given the disc, **catch with GRE-level focus**. Then calm down and handle.
    - Commit with the disc!!!
- When defending a cutter
    - Always stay on the force side (which is difficult) by (1) shuffling on toes and (2) position almost parallely to the strike direction.
        - Use the whole body to stop the cutter is not always a good idea because my hip is then turned.
    - Prevent a deep/strike rather than an in-cut.
    - For floaty (deep) throws, **do math** on the landing point that is appropriate to my height.
- When marking: Use FUC's trick: shuffle in front of the active shoulder, expand arms instead of swinging.


Excited to play the first US tournament of this wholesome team sport this weekend. Hope I will be ready to enjoy and learn from it. My invididual goal: help gaining at least 1 yard or contributing to at least one turn-over of the opponent in at least 3 matches.
