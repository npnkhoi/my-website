Previously: [Aggie Classic - Day 1]({%post_url 2023-09-30-aggie-classic-1%}), [My pre-tourney individual goals]({%post_url 2023-09-29-first-ultimate-tourney%}).

I first recap our last 3 matches. Then I will reflect about the whole experience of playing here.

## Matches Recap

Game 5: UTD 13 - ? SFA. We won by a large margin.
- We won pretty easily. They forced backhand?!
- I think I scored once here (or maybe the next game). After someone called "end zone" on our vert. stack, I was at the top. I first cut to the break side, which was initially a bad idea because it was not open. But then the handler reset the disk, to the open side. I am the third man in that situation, so I stroke while my marker did not notice. I scored, spiked the disc, and it got warped.
- We used this chance to practice our vert. stack. The point is to push the stack up, except Number 1, whenever Number 5 cuts and clears.

Game 6: UTD - Tarelton (-State University?). We lost.
- This team is more athletic than us.
- Defensively, Tarelton has a player poaching one of our cutters (which are in the vert. stack). This made our offense hard.
- In this match, the coaches decided we should play ho-stack when seeing the vert-stack doesn't work.
	- **Horizontal stack** basically has 2 horizontal lines of 3 (lower, handlers) and 4 (higher, cutters). It worked particularly well for swingings, thus suitable to counter the zone (i.e., cup) defense.
	- Most of the time, 3 handlers flow the disc by swinging.
	- Among 4 cutters, the middle two are **poppers**, who are split to run deep and under to tear our the defenders. The other two are **wings**, who basically (1) distract the deep defender and (2) go under to get the disc from the side handler if possible.
- Being a wing, I don't remember making any significant contributions in this game. I even messed up with my cuts (slow undercuts, sticking in the deep for too long, etc.)

Game 7: UTD - Sam Houston. We lost.
- They played zone defense, so we had to adjust our ho-stack by asking both poppers to go under (but not into the cup) as soon as they saw an open space.
- I scored once by sneaking behind the end-zone defenders. An easy one. I didn't spike this time so that no more discs are destroyed.
- In the last point, I played well. I defended by shuffling and using body to block undercuts. In offense, as a popper, I found some nice open space to cut in and got the disc. Unluckily, we lost that point and the match.

## Observations

*WOOF, the team of UT Dallas*

As an avid player from a Vietnamese college moving to the US, this tournament allowed me to technically learn so much and culturally experience much more. I am listing my observations randomly below:
- Our coaches emphasized the important of the sideline in the play of a team. Compared to soccer or basketball, non-playing players have to sit on the bench. Here, they need to stand up. 
	- Before the pull, they sing spiritual songs and make noise. 
	- In game, they call 'UP!'. They communicate with the defenders about the cutters' position (which they cannot see) -- phrases like "you are not, X", or "no around/no strike", "inside/around", "more left, more right", "left/right" (about the disc).
	- After a winning point, they all storm to the field and cheer everyone. It is both cute and warm.
	- After a losing point, they shout "We up!" and console the line.
- Our coaches also emphasized the culture of *asking questions*. They seriously thank and recognize us after a game where we asked questions about technicality, game rules, etc. They said asking questions is a sign of an enthusiastic learner, to which I agree.
- After a game, our team (UTD) sit together and do the following. Each person will anonymously describe another that makes them feel good or learn a lot from during the tournament. Then they announce their name, and pass a [CENSORED] object to that person. The chain goes around until everyone is addressed. It was truly heart-warming to be in that circle.
- In men's ultimate here, it seems like they rarely have spirit circles. Instead, they form two circles to talk internally and shout "Good game, {other team}".
- Students here have greatly supportive parents. They drove hours to see their kids playing, sitting on the sideline, and cheer them.
- US students have cars. I went with them in their cars for 200 miles to the tournament.

A core memory about UTD and frisbee has been formed in me. A well-spent weekend outside of Dallas.
