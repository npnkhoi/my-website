Listen to [the Jazz soundtrack I used while cutting my hair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqME1y6Mlyg)

I have cut my own hair for the first time!
- Reasons are abundent, including being lazy to find a barber, being frugal to pay for it, desire to shape my appearance by my own craftmanship, and curiosity of whether I can do it. 
- My first memory of getting a haircut is when I was about 2-3 years old. My mom took me to a barber, and I cried a lot. I grew up going with my dad to various barbers over the years, until I was about 15. Then I went to barber's alone, which is already a jump in maturity. Going to barber's is a taken-for-granted part of my life that I grew to feel more and more uneasy about.
- I think we don't have to go to barber's to have our hair cut. We can do it by ourselves, for free. We can also avoid loss in translation with the barber (which is what I suffered a lot over the years). The hair cut results have always been a stochastic variable for me. Given how important the hair is in a person's appearance, such stochasticity is of course undersirable.
- The thought of doing it myself manifested during Covid. I bought a hair clipper back then. But my mom was extremely against it. And I did not trust myself that much. And I had appointments where my hair should look acceptable. Therefore, I delayed it. When I moved to the US, I brought the hair clipper with me.
- My first actual hair cut procedure took about 1 hour. I followed [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrTC5D-zYBs). The first moment when I let the clipper touch my hair was the scariest moment. After that, it started to get fun when I realized I was making progress. During that procedure, clipping the hair on top of my head is the trickest part. My brain was fooled completely by the mirror. Clipping the back was almost as challenging.
- After the cut, holding my own hair is a surreal experience. Probably because I never hold a significant mass of my body that is now detached. 
- Cleaning the whole mess I created was tiring.
- Thinking broadly, being able to do hair cut anytime is a very convenient skill to have. I know girls usually cut their bangs themselves, which is awesome. I intend to cut my own hair regularly. Very proud of myself as a human to can cut his own hair.
