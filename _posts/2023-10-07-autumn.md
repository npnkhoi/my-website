Song: [MÃ¹a Thu Cho Em (Spotify)](https://open.spotify.com/track/0KDds7fY55mWgf7tg4bIGF?si=f969c23a26014b98), i.e., 'The Autumn for You'

It is getting pretty cold in this town. At 7am, the temperature is as low as 53 degree Farenheit (12 Celcilus). I like this cold! 
- Curious to know how playing frisbee in this climate feels like. Curious to see how people's appearance and behaviours change.
- Excited to whether winter clothes myself. About to buy thicker blanket. (The autonomy of engineering one's own life for emerging adults is great.)

<!-- Flashback: Autumn was the month when I started to have a lot more feelings to NT. -->
