title: Productive breaks
---

These days, I usually have to do some repetitive tasks like grading and data labelling. These tasks should ideally be automated, but it is a long way until it is.

So how to be productive in such case? Here's my takes:
- Have intentional, structured breaks
- Time blocks (yeah, Pomodoro)
- Focus (turn off the phone)
- Find meaning in the repetition. In data labelling, it is to gain more insights into the domain. For grading, it is to develop grading mastery so that I will grade faster will still being able to get paid at the end of the month (as a TA).
