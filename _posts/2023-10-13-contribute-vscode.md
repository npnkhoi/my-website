title: Contributed a bit to VSCode

I have contributed a tiny part to the development of VSCode. The lastest release (1.18.0) fixed several bugs, including mine! It was a bug that makes my language server for C++ crash mysteriously. My issue can be found on the [milestone page](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cpptools/milestone/144).

VSCode is an amazing tool. It is beautiful, fast, and extremely functional. Without it, my work with large computing clusters would be much harder because it is the best option out there to enable a "native" coding experience via SSH tunnel. It makes the setting hassles of programming a bit easier.
