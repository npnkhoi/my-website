When you research team is about to submit a paper, and there people multiple people involved in the project, and you need to decide the order of the authors on the publication, you may have to say:

> I should be **the first author**.

I wonder if there are better ways to convey with idea. This way of saying is extremely hard to vocalize becasue it is a complex statement that means multiple things:
1. I do **the most** amount of work in this project, 
2. my contribution is the **most important** thing to the completion of this paper, 
3. I am confident and probably **not being humble** (maybe only inhumble for this occasion, or I am always that self-entitled), and 
4. you (the co-authors) must either leave that position to me or enter an unfriendly **conflict** with me, and our relationship may be weird afterwards.

The first two are the positive and productive way to think about it, while the last two is negatively self-concious.

BTW, the author ordering thing is unfortunate. Text is linear, so authors' name also need to be lined in a linear order. Therefore there must be a single first author, even when multiple people contributed equally to the paper. 
I guess that is not always a problem in industry. There, a team generally has a manager, and multiple workers, each of whom has their own title that can specifically be attributed to for an area of work behind a product. An team behind a paper, on the other hand, usually does not have such titles. So maybe the difference is in how labor is divided in the two contexts. In industry, such a division is contracted, fully respected, and long-term. People are usually willing to stay in one duty and be good at it. On the other hand, in academia, although such a division still exists for practical reasons, they are expectedly ephemeral (because most researchers want to be well-rounded). In fact, reseachers can benefit from achievements showing that they are good at *all* things research-related (writing, coding, doing math, planning, etc.)
