I played much less this time because
- For the first few matches, I was not accustomed to run hard in dry and cold weather. It's hard to breath and my ears get uncomfortably cold.
- There was a friendly (thus unserious) match that I didn't feel like playing.
- The last match was pretty serious because the opponent was UT Arlington, a North Texas team, and we are the champion of this region last year. Therefore, the last few points are played by "the kill line" only. Those points are actually very educational and thrilling. Here's [the last point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzy3CjKaGkY).

The wind was also hard on everyone. I made some ineffective cuts (horizontal, or completely bodied by the mark). But I do handled some more because my team had only 2 lines this time. I actually felt comfortable doing that! And I made some falling and semi-layouts! That is because I was trusted to run deep, and the wind made the disc hard to catch. My most memorable play was when I am standing in the endzone waiting to catch the disc (instead of running through it and accepting it may not be a score), then being D-ed in shame.
