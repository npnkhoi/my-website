It is pretty chilling around here in Richardson. Temperature can reach 32 degree Farenheit, which is the freezing point of water. I am surviving thanks to the clothes I bought during [my trip to Canada]({%post_url 2023-03-18-canada%}) earlier this year.

Also around this time that I experience how fun Haloween is in the US. I first saw people celebrating Haloween during my highschool, where there are an even with that name hosted by a taskforce. But it is generally a music performance with some food and drinks and slightly scary cosplays. Haloweens at Fulbright (my undergrad) got a bit more interesting during 2019, but got blocked by Covid after that. 

Now I actually see how much people enjoy it. My frisbee friends went to a tournament where people cosplay AND play frisbee. Students on campus where funny costume (dinasaur, witches, star wars, batman, etc.) throughout the week. Especially, kids in my neighborhood also wear funny costume that make them look extremely cute (imagine a 3-year-old in a banana costume). They went knocking the doors while their parents standing afar, watching happily. A group of 8 kids knocked on our door while I was having dinner, saying 'trick or treat'. I was not prepared, but I had some snacks in my bedroom, so I just grab those and give to them.

Here comes a festive season in America!
