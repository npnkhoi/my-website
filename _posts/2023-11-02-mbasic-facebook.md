*The website `mbasic.facebook.com` is slowly dying.*

I have a slight addiction to Facebook. Most of my Vietnamese friends are on that platform, so I learned to be addicted to it to keep in touch with my friends. When I went to college, being focus mattered more, so I found ways to use Facebook less. One of those ways is to use `mbasic.facebook.com`. Firstly, it is ugly and inconvenient with a non-responsive design, which are the frictions that stop me from endlessly scrolling. Secondly, it loads much faster than the full-fledge version of Facebook, which saves me time when I really want to go there to find some information.

Now, Facebook is announcing the coming closure of the website... I am not sure how I will use Facebook then.
