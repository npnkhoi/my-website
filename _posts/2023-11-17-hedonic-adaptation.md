title: Breakups and Hedonic Adaptation
tags: life
---

A non trivial ability of human: to recover from trauma (or extreme happiness) -- hedonic adaptation[^1].

But how come? Does it mean pains are just meaningless? 

Probably not. We will always feel pain when we think about the trauma.

Breakups are a part of having relationships, just as death is a part of life. Death makes us appreciate life. Breakups make us appreciate relationships. There is something about breakups that is very counter-intuitive and dilemmous. Your heart tells you one way, while your brain tells you another. 

We are just poor agents who cannot satisfy both commands at the same time because there is something we are just unable to do.
