Went to Minnesota to celebrate Thanksgiving with a host family that is 6 generations away from me (!). Aftermaths are a lot to unpack, revisit, and reflect.

The memories
- Found out about packing rules of Sun Country and Spirit. Struggled a bit to pack all belongings in a school backpack. Eventually it worked.
- (Appreciated deodorant.)
- Spent a whole day at the Mall of America with a really nice host.
    - The host was so nice that I later gave my Fulbright hoodie to them.
    - Introduced to the world of perfume: strong smell, light smell, cinnamon, spice, etc. The smell on paper is different from on skin.
    - Introduced to guilt-free shopping and ended up buying nice clothes for the winter in America. My perception towards money was then a bit warped?
    - Tried amusement rides for the first time and got freaked out entirely.
    - Tried Greek food at "Opa!". It was ok but dry.
- College tour: 
    - [Macalester](https://www.macalester.edu/) and [Carleton](https://www.carleton.edu/): famous liberal arts schools that actually look pretty simple and squared.
    - [St. Thomas](https://www.stthomas.edu/): a Catholic school that look like beautiful church.
    - [U. of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/): like an entire downtown area itself -- big and pretty modern.
- Ate good food at an El Azteca outlet.
- Wrote in my journal "spending ones of the best days in the US so far".

- Went to [Science Museum of Minnesota](https://new.smm.org/). Actually first time to a science museum, so pretty happy to see STEM experiments on display.

- Ate *Minnesota Wild Rice*, which is a soup of chicken and some veggies that can be served in a "cup". Embarrassedly asked my host for payment help because the restaurant did not accept ApplePay.
- Saw *Minnehaha Falls* (funny name huh?) at sunset. Surprised to see such a nice natural sight remained as a public place for trails instead of being privately owned.
- Thanksgiving
    - The host family threw a cozy party with a ton of excellent Vietnamese food. There was also a chocolate fountain.
    - I grilled chicken, "nem", and shrimp outdoors while drinking hot coffee and talking about life. I could see my breath turned to smoke.
- Black Friday
    - Talked with distant relatives. Watched [The Menu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Menu_(2022_film)) but did not heard the audio clearly.
    - Walked in a 1-mile trail at 25 degree Fahrenheit.
    - Learned to scored >100 points in a Bowling round. Played with the host family. Much fun.

Some ideas for lifestyle-building
- I should define my own rich life, carefully.
- Social status quo was debunked a bit. Middle-class people can be friendly and humble so that lower-class people can start feeling proud about themselves. I am rightful to be confident, friendly, and helpful.
