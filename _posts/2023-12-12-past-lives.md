[Past Lives by sapientdream](https://youtu.be/-TXtyYZIiWc?si=dbEIY8gzu3xD-eV8)

I heard this song a lot on Instagram but I did not know its name. One day I was bored and it popped up in my mind. Suddenly I desired my room to be filled with the song. I was finding this song for the next 2 days by all methods I coud think of: humming to Shazam, swiping throught hundreds of reels, looking for articles about popular reel songs. Finally, I went to the Spotify radio of the most similar song I got from the approaches above. And I found it!

I guess songs we like the most are those that provoke interesting feelings in us. *Past Lives* provokes a sense of looking-back-in-life or the-world-is-too-big-and-we-are-too-small feelings. 

[Bent by Joey Pecoraro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpBA0cQCi3I) 

This is a no-lyrics soundtrack with mildly sad and lovely rythm. Especially, the song is augmented by a snippet of a 1943 radio episode. It is a conversation between an old husband forgiving and understanding his young wife for having an affair while he's away for military. He said "I'm old. You're young and beautiful. You are my first love. You are my last.". Very thought provoking. The conversation is taken from the radio episode on August 23, 1943 named ["Lady Hamilton"](https://www.oldtimeradiodownloads.com/drama/theater-of-romance/lady-hamilton-1943-08-23).

[Just Stay by Mauve](https://open.spotify.com/track/1OomEBeqPPdUhBUhdAxoz6?si=46ac7f31aef24ba7)

This is an EDM soundtrack with super sick build up and drop. At the same time, the song is not "noisy" like normal EDM tracks.

[Lôí Nhỏ by Den Vau](https://youtu.be/KKc_RMln5UY?si=Cgr80Ob1G2aNUwxB)

A Vietnamese song wehre the lyrics is just too beautiful. In that, there is a guy coming from an underpriviledged and silent background. He falls in love with a girl from a luxury and competitive life. And they cannot converge in their future.
