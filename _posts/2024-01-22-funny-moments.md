*My pov in the lecture hall*

New semester came, I was sitting in a lecture hall, waiting for the first lecture of the semester to begin. At that time, a Chinese-looking gentleman entered the room, spotted an empty seat next to me. Then, he looked at me dead into the eyes and aksed "Are you Chinese?". 

I smiled and said no. 

He then proceeded to asked another student and ended up sitting with them.
