A new semester has come. I was sitting in a lecture hall, waiting for the first lecture of the semester to begin. At that time, a Chinese-looking gentleman entered the room, spotted an empty seat next to me. Then, he looked at me dead into the eyes and aksed:

> Are you Chinese? 

I smiled and said:

> No.

He then proceeded to ask another student and ended up sitting with them.
