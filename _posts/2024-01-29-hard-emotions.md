## Ã‰nouement

/ey-noo-mahn/

The bittersweet feeling of realizing that a certain period of your life or even an entire relationship, is coming to an end.

## Sonder

/son-der/

The feeling when you realize that everyone, including strangers, have a unique life just as complex as your own. Each with love, problems and ambitions.

## Adronitis

/a-dro-ni-tis/

The desire to get to know people more deeply, even if it takes time, and the excitement of that potential connection.

## Nordus Tollens

/noh-dus-tah-luhns/

The sense that your life no longer makes sense, like a story where the plot suddenly takes an unexpected turn.

## Liberosis

/lib-er-oh-sis/

The feeling of wanting to care less about things, a sense of calmness that comes when you let go of unnecessary concerns.
