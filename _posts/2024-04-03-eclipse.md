I am honored to share that I have recently appointed to the prestigious position of Volunteer for the Total Eclipse event on UT Dallas campus. I had to compete with an unknowingly large number of applications to get this position.

The total eclipse this year is very unique to the Dallas-Forth Worth area. Somebody says it won't go over the are again in a few hundred years (but it will appear somewhere else on Earth earlier, for sure).

In celebration of this once-in-a-lifetime event, the UT Dallas administration launches the campaign "No Comet Left Inside" to force everybody to come outside and watch the eclipse on that date. In particular, all classes between 1-2pm on April 8 will be cancelled. There will be 3 observation sites, one of which is where will be operating as a science explainer.

In preparation for this honor, I will watch as much youtube videos about total eclipse as possible. Wish me luck!!
