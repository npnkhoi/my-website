A quote from A Little Life

![alt text](</assets/Screenshot 2024-07-07 at 07.46.09.png>)

This quote shows how ephemeral life is, just like a 3-day vacation. You may be excited for it in the beginning, thinking you have seemingly infinite amount of time ahead. However, it will just go by along the passage of time. In no time, you will look back and exclaim "Oh wow, so that's it... That's all I got in this life. Now it's over."

People in your forties and beyond: Is this accurate?
