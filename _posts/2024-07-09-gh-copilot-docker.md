Things going on here:
- On the left:
    - I asked Copilot "how to install docker in a remote server of x84_64 arch". It gave me a fully correct tutorial. I could install Docker without ever leaving VSCode.
    - I have a knowledge gap of not knowing the relationship between `x86_64` and `amd64`, and asking Copilot gives me an enligtening answer that I won't be able to find that quick by googling. 
- In the middle: Is the Markdown preview of a package's README. After installing Docker, I just following the "Install with Docker" instructions to have exactly the same environment as the package's authors.
- On the right: The result of Docker installation, which is some sweet success message.

I love being a programmer in 2024.
