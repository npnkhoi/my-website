Mailing in the US

In Vietnam, sending physical documents is pretty rare. It's still there as an accessible service, but we usually do not use that a lot.

Here, mailing and delivery in general is ubiquitous.

Mailing. Even for highly important documents like Social Security Number (as important as Can Cuoc Cong Dan in Vietnam), Insurance cards, etc., they leave it at the mailbox outside of the house. Legally, that is a private and non-invasible place. But it is still pretty easy to be stolen.

Delivery. Expensive stuffs like laptops, monitors, smartphones, etc. are left at the door.
