Hello! This page serves as my informal and 'non-standard' self-introduction.

## Who I really am

I have been consistenly fascinated by numbers and computers. Since 2015, I have learned Math and coding a lot. I started out as a Math student in grade schools, then switched to Computer Science because of the job prospects. But to be fair, programming feels like telekenesis to me. I may skip a lunch to try building a mobile app, for no reason. 

Regarding my personalities, my friends tell me that I am philosophical and optimistic. I usually ask people about their purposes in life. I believe most people are born with a purely kind heart, grow into badness at varying degrees, and can be good if they will.

I love team sports. I mostly play ultiamate frisbee and badminton, and enjoy watching soccer.

If you have anything in common with me, please say hi. I do like making new friends.

## Manual of me
Teamwork is tricky. While I will learn to blend well with a team I'm in, my co-workers should also know how to 'use' me for the common good. Below is a guide to do that.

**Communication**: I turn off texing apps during deep work. For other time, I do enjoy small talks and socializing.

**Feedback**: I am getting better at taking harsh feedback. Feel free to talk straight and not sugarcoat anything. I *love* improving from feedback.

**Productivity preferences**:
- I value getting things done. I start a project when I know how to end it.
- Humour boosts efficiency. My best teammates can find joy in hard work.
- Deep work over multitasking. My deep work rituals require sunlight, cool air, and silence.

**My struggles**
- I cannot efficiently participate in a Zoom call longer than 90 minutes.
- Sometimes, I subconciously judge people and take criticism personal. I am working on that, I promise.


## My failures
*In reversed chronological order. To be updated.*
- I was proudly rejected by IJCAI, a big-deal CS conference.
- I played Chess poorly. I lose most of my matches in my chess club. Chess is definitely a big failure of my life.
- I have turned off Facebook notifications about reactions, but I am still checking it manually :)
- 50% of my jokes are lame.
- First year of college, I saw a businesswoman I had seen before. To know if she still remembered me, I asked 'Do you miss me?'
- At high school, I wanted to study in the US so I tried ACT. My Reading score is 12/36. Every reading test was a nightmare.
- At middle school, I fell into mud before a class. My clothes looked like sh*t, literally.
