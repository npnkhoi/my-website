title: The PhD Journal

Welcome to *The PhD Journal*, where I share my thoughts and emotions during my time in graduate school. The topics include artificial intelligence, computer science, education, sports, life, and random photos. I try to post a few entries every week, most of which are unfortunately not polished. However, they should still be a good channel to establish a deep connection between us.

Enjoy the ride!
