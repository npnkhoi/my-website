<!-- Welcome to *The PhD Journal*,  -->
 ... where I comment on academia, machine learning, travels, books, and life on a weekly basis. See [posts by tags]({{base_url}}/tags).
<!-- . The topics include artificial intelligence, computer science, education, sports, life, and random photos. I try to post a few entries every week, most of which are unfortunately not polished. However, they should still be a good channel to establish a deep connection between us. -->

<!-- Enjoy the ride! -->
