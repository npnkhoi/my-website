Welcome to my online journal, where I share my thoughts and emotions during my PhD life. The topics may include computer science, education, sports, "life", and random photos. I try to post a few entries every week. Most of them are unfortunately not polished, but they are still a good channel to establish a deep connection between me and you.

Enjoy the ride!
