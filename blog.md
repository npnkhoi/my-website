Welcome to my online journal, where I share my thoughts and emotions during my PhD life. The topics range from Computer Science and education to sports, life, and random photos. I try to post a few entries every week as a way to remind myself to keep learning, thinking, and feeling. Most of them are unfortunately not polished, but they are a good channel to establish a deep connection between me and you.

Enjoy the ride!
