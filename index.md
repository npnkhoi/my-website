I am Khoi, an undergrad at Fulbright University Vietnam. I am interested in studying the nature of languages and bring that into computers. I am actively looking for PhD opportunities in AI for Fall 2024.

Research interests:
1. Natural Language Processing: text embeddings, text generation, speech recognition, program synthesis, etc.
2. Computer game playing: reinforcement learning, adversarial search
3. Software Engineering by applying Machine Learning techniques

# News
- [Mar 2023] Our paper, [A Framework to Develop Automatic Speech Recognition for Low Resource Languages](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3545947.3573271), won the Third Prize of the ACM Student Research Competition at SIGCSE TS 2023!
