I am Khoi, a PhD student in [Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas](https://cs.utdallas.edu/). I study Natural Language Processing under the supervision of [Dr. Vincent Ng](https://www.hlt.utdallas.edu/~vince/). Currently I am working on argument mining and multimodal reasoning. In the past, I also worked with [Dr. Raghuram Ramanujan](https://www.davidson.edu/people/raghu-ramanujan) on Monte Carlo Tree Search.

<!-- Research interests:
1. Natural Language Processing: text embeddings, text generation, speech recognition, program synthesis, etc.
2. Computer game playing: reinforcement learning, adversarial search
3. Software Engineering by applying Machine Learning techniques -->
