Xin chào! I am Khoi, a doctoral student in the Human Language Technology Research Institute, the University of Texas at Dallas. Currently, I am working on **computational meme processing** with my supervisor, Professor [Vincent Ng](https://www.hlt.utdallas.edu/~vince/), hopefully automating some aspects of human humour.
<!-- In the past, I worked with [Dr. Raghuram Ramanujan](https://www.davidson.edu/people/raghu-ramanujan) on Monte Carlo Tree Search. -->

When not at school, I have been seen doing different types of Machine Learning such as computer vision at [Solano Energy](https://solano.energy/), symbolic regression at [Koidra Tech](https://www.koidra.ai/), and NLP at the [National University of Singapore](https://ims.nus.edu.sg/events/rips2022/).

Before going into ML research, I was a product/software-engineer intern at [Holistics](https://www.holistics.io/). During that period, I also built [OneSchedule](https://npnkhoi.github.io/oneschedule/), a course planning website used by *many* students at Fulbright University Vietnam.
In a further past, I was competiting in Competitive Programming at national and regional level ([CodeForces profile](https://codeforces.com/profile/pazabol), [press](https://fulbright.edu.vn/fulbright-students-win-bronze-medal-at-icpc-asia-can-tho-regional-contest/)).
